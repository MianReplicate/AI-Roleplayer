Use command /menu and get started at any time!

How can I get started?
1. Install the bot into your server
2. Set the bot master role using /set_bot_role, this determines who can configure the bot
3. Get an IMGBB key and OpenRouter key (Free!)
4. Run /menu, go to Server Configuration, and put in your keys
5. Done! You are ready now to start new roleplays, and/or create new characters, worlds, and instruction prompts to use!

How can I assign an avatar to a character?
- Use the /set_avatar command to edit a character's avatar. Make sure you have an IMGBB key set up so that the bot can upload your avatar and use it!

How do I edit the model and its properties?
- Take a look at the /edit_model command!

What's OpenRouter?
- OpenRouter is a middle-man website that lets providers host a multitude of AI models on the site. This allows you, the user, to swap whatever AI model you are using to another easily if you do not like the one you are on.
- If you are planning on not paying, you get 50 free requests daily for free models on OpenRouter. If you have put at least $10 at any time in OpenRouter, that limit increases to 1000 free requests daily (even if you no longer have $10).

What are the different prompt types? Character, instruction, world..
- Character are definitions you define for the bot to play. The bot will use this definition to simulate a character when it roleplays
- Instructions dictate the style of the roleplay and how the bot *should* roleplay. If you want to make it a discord-like chat or novel like, you can tell the bot to do that!
- World dictates the environment and scenario for what the roleplay takes place in. It adds context to the roleplay for the bot to use.

One last thing, this is being run on my own personal server that may or may not be overloaded depending on how many people use this bot. As such, I‚Äôve left the source public to let others host the bot if they want. With that said, happy roleplaying!
